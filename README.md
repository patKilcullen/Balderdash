To Start

`npm run seed` - sync and seed database 
`npm run start:dev`-  start application - will both start  server and build client side files using webpack

`npm run start:dev:logger`- same as start:dev, but with SQL queries 
`npm run start:dev:seed`-  start  server and seed database (useful whenmaking schema changes and don't want to run seed script separately)
